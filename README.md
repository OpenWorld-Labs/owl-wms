## Setup

Run `make virtualenv` to create a virtual environment for first-time setup.

Note: Ensure you have `python3.12` installed. This will create a virtual environment in `.venv`.

Run `make install` to install dependencies including linters and formatters.

Run `make lint` to actually run the linters and formatters in the repo.
